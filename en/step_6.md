## Challenge: Create your profile picture

Can you use the costume paint tool in Scratch to create your own profile picture to go with a username?

If you want to try drawing using shapes that you can move around then switch to vector mode by clicking the button on the bottom right:

Here's an example:

You can also save your picture so you can use it on websites or apps that use a profile picture. Right-click on a costume to save it to a local file:

![screenshot](images/usernames-save-costume.png)

Images created in bitmap mode will be saved as '.png' files. Images created in vector mode will be saved as '.svg' files.

'.png' files are more widely used, you can switch to bitmap mode before saving to get a '.png' file (undo will get you back to vector mode.)
