## Saving your favourite usernames

You probably want to consider a few different usernames. Let’s add usernames that you like to a list.

+ Create a new list called `names I like`:

+ The list will appear on the stage. Drag it to the right of your person sprite and make it wider.

+ Add the `Button4` <span style="color: green;">✔</span> sprite, and drag it across the stage to the right of the speech bubble.

+ Add code to the button sprite to add the current username to `names I like` when the tick is clicked.

+ Test your code by clicking on the person sprite until you find a username you like and then clicking on the <span style="color: green;">✔</span>.

+ You can export your list of usernames to a text file to save them. Right-click on the `names I like` list on the stage and choose **Export** and choose a place to save the list as a file.

	You now have a text file containing a list of names that you can open with Notepad or another text editor.
