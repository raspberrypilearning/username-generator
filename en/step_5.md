## Challenge: add a number

On popular websites and apps, it can be really hard to find a username that someone else isnâ€™t already using. Or you might find that the username you use on one site is already taken on other sites. To get around that, you could add a number to the end of your username. **Remember not to use your age or your date or year of birth.**

Can you use the following blocks to generate usernames with a random number at the end?
