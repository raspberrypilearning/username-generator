## Introduction

It’s important not to use your real name or any personal information in your online username. In this project you’ll generate usernames that you can use on websites like Scratch.

To try out the finished project:

+ Click the girl to generate a new username;
+ When you find a username you like click on the <span style="color: green;">✔</span> to add it to the list;
+ Right-click on the username list to save your list of usernames to a file.
