## Introduction

It’s important not to use your real name or any personal information in your online username. In this project you’ll generate fun usernames that you can use on websites like Scratch.

### What you will make

To try out the finished project:

+ Click the girl sprite to generate a new username
+ When you find a username you like, click on the <span style="color: green;">✔</span> to add it to the list
+ Right-click on the list icon to save your usernames to a file
