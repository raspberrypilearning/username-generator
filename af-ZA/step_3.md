Real and imaginary animals and creatures work well in the `nouns` list. Try to think of unusual ones.

Here are some ideas for the `adjectives` list:

+ Metale: sink, koper, yster, messing, silwer, goud
+ Kleure: Crimson, Aqua, Magenta, Golden, Indigo
+ Edelstene: Kwarts, Smaragd, Sapphire, Diamant
+ Habitats: Maan, Woestyn, Sneeu, Jungle, Bos, Ruimte

Remember to hide the lists from the stage when testing your project.
